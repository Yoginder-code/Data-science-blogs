				    <p><b>Abstract</b>—Planning and strategy are the basic business foundations that every business does very carefully. Businesses have been changed and the introduction of technology made it easier to formulate strategic planning. The study of this paper includes the example of company called PWC (one of the big four). It gives us the idea of how this company used technological tools to formulate planning and strategy especially in this pandemic of covid19. The study shows the analysis of different functions done by company and how they are making plans and strategy to build up business models for their clients in this covid19 pandemic. It shows how efficiently company using modern tools (essential 8 technologies) to run business by working from home. It shows how the company is strategizing to maintain workforce, operations and supply chain, communications strategy, how to maintain data and how to use technology efficiently to maintain the health of workforce.</p>
				    
				    <h6 class="mt-5 mb-3">INTRODUCTION:</h6>
				    <p>  Planning is the process of thinking about the activities required to achieve a desired goal. It is the first and foremost activity to achieve desired results. Strategy has many definitions, but generally involves setting strategic goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). The senior leadership of an organization is generally tasked with determining strategy. Strategy can be planned (intended) or can be observed as a pattern of activity (emergent) as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. Strategic planning is an organization’s process of defining its strategy, or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy. It is here that priorities are set.[1] It may also extend to control mechanisms for guiding the implementation of the strategy. Strategic planning became prominent in corporations during the 1960s and remains an important aspect of strategic management. It is executed by strategic planners or strategists, who involve many parties and research sources in their analysis of the organization and its relationship to the environment in which it competes.[1] Hit by the Covid-19 slump followed by social distancing and a nationwide lockdown, businesses are experiencing major impacts no matter how established they are and are having
 
                        to re-look at how they manage and operate their business including re-visitation of their business plan.
                        It has become challenging for most businesses to keep their financial wheels turning during the lockdown period due to less revenue churn and the general uncertainty in the global financial environment. Unfortunately, the impact on start-ups or small businesses can be way more brutal as they have scarcer cash reserves and a smaller margin for managing sudden slumps. The ripple effect of this shutdown will have a key impact on India’s economy, as all business sectors get affected resulting in low revenue generation due to an eventual halt/slump on the sale of products and/or services. It is expected that India’s growth rate in FY20-21 will be down to 2 percent from a range of 4.7 percent-5.2 percent as was predicted.[2] Companies are adopting collaboration tools to support working from home and retailers are using con- tactless payment and delivery methods. With social distancing enforced, the use of drones for supplies is on the rise too.[3] PWC is working on different areas in covid19 like maintaining workforce, communications and strategy, customers and rev- enue, operation and supply chain, focus on data and head office function. Covid19 have changed the style of strategic planning and companies like PWC is adopting new technological tools to solve their client’s problem. They are using essential 8 technologies to build up plans for their clients in covid19. Technology has the power to disrupt, shifting a market almost overnight. Technology is growing at rapid pace and is already defining what’s next. PwC’s New Services and Emerging Tech team analysed the business impact and commercial viability of more than 250 emerging technologies to zero in on the “Essential Eight” that matter most for business, across every industry, over the next three to five years - 76 percent of CEOs in our annual survey are worried about the speed of tech change. And 64 percent acknowledge that changes in the technology used to run their businesses will be disruptive over the next five years. Emerging technology should be a key part of every company’s corporate strategy. The Essential Eight are the technology building blocks that we believe every organization must consider. While each company’s strategy for how to best exploit — and combine — them will vary, these technologies will have a profound global impact on business, employees, and customers.[4] We will discuss this method in
                         
                        the further study.

				    <h6 class="mt-5 mb-3">PWC AND THE ESSENTIAL EIGHT TECHNOLOGIES:</h6>
				    <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers is a multinational professional ser- vices network of firms, operating as partnerships under the PwC brand. PwC ranks as the second-largest professional services network in the world [9] and is considered one of the Big Four accounting firms, along with Deloitte, EY and KPMG.[10] PwC firms operate in 157 countries, 742 locations, with 276,000 people.[11] As of 2019, 26 percent of the workforce worked in the Americas, 26 percent in Asia, 32 percent in Western Europe and 5 percent in Middle East and Africa.[12] The company’s global revenues were 42.4 billion dollar in FY 2019, of which 17.4 billion dollar was generated by its Assurance practice, 10.7 billion dollar by its Tax and Legal practice and 14.4 billion dollar by its Advisory practice.[12]
                        PWC has introduced 8 essential technologies that are being used in forming plans and strategy for the business. These tools helped the organisation in covid19 in building the plans during crises and help their clients with the use of technology. Company is also using these tools to make the workforce and several other functions for efficient. The companies essentials 8 technologies are given below:

                        Software algorithms are automating complex decision- making tasks to mimic human thought processes and senses. Artificial intelligence (AI) is not a monolithic technology. A subset of AI, machine learning, focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to learn, understand, reason, plan and act when blasted with data. Machine learning carries enormous potential for the creation of meaningful products and services. Examples include hospitals using a library of scanned images to quickly and accurately detect and diagnose cancer; insurance companies digitally and automatically recognizing and assessing car damage; and security companies trading clunky typed passwords for voice recognition.

                        <li class="mb-2">	<b>Augmented Reality:</b>
                            Augmented reality (AR) is a visual or audio “overlay” on the physical world that uses contextualized digital information
                            to augment the user’s real-world view. AR-enabled smart glasses help warehouse workers fulfil orders with precision, airline manufacturers assemble planes and electrical workers make repairs. The power of bringing information to the point of action in a seamless, unobtrusive manner is undeniable. This blending of the physical and virtual worlds is cracking open a new realm for businesses across the board to explore.

                                A blockchain is a distributed digital database or, more broadly, a digital ledger that uses software algorithms to record and confirm transactions with reliability and anonymity. The record of events is shared between many parties and information once entered cannot be altered. Blockchain has the potential to usher in an era of autonomous digital commerce.

                                    Depending on their design, drones vary greatly in their capacity. Some drones need wide spaces to take off, while quadcopters can squeeze into a column of space. Some drones are water based; others can operate and navigate semi- autonomously (via remote control) or fully autonomously (via onboard computers). Companies are using drones for wide-ranging reasons, including surveillance, survey, sport, cinematography and delivery.

                                        The Internet of things (IoT) is a network of physical objects
                                        — devices, vehicles, appliances — embedded with sensors, software, network connectivity and computing capability that enable them to collect, exchange and act on data, usually without human intervention. Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to its use in the manufacturing and industrial sectors, aka Industry
                                        4.0. Both types are integral to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

                                        Robots are machines with enhanced sensing, control and intelligence used to automate, augment or assist human activ- ities. The robot market is poised for growth in a broad range of services applications. These applications are transforming manufacturing and non-manufacturing operations with new capabilities that address the challenges of working in changing, uncertain and uncontrolled environments, such as alongside humans without being a danger to them.

                                        Virtual reality (VR) abolishes logistical limitations. In a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment, viewers can use special equipment to interact with the simulation in realistic ways. The gaming and en- tertainment industries are obvious proving grounds for VR. However, VR has the potential to transform many other indus- tries as well, especially in the realm of experiential training where workers can be put into hazardous, difficult or cost- prohibitive situations without the intense risks associated with these activities in the physical world.
